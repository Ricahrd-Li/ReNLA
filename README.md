# Re:Zero - Utility Library in Numerical Linear Algebra World 

I am Richard from USTC, and I write this library for the course "Numerical Linear Algebra".
The textbook is "《数值线性代数》，徐树方，北京大学出版社". 

### Feature
1. Basic `Vec` class for column vectors with basic slicing supported. 
2. Basic `Matrix` class represented by vector of column `Vec`, with basic slicing supported.
3. Linear system solver including:
    + LU decompose
    + Basic gauss elimination 
    + gauss elimination with column pivot selecting
    + To be continued...
4. Basic `Timer` class for speed measurement. 

### Note for homework
+ Homework are named `chap$chapterNum$` with functions named `homework$chapterNum$_$questionNum$` in `src/`;
